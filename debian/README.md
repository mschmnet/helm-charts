# Debian: A simple Helm chart

Run a single pod of Debian.

This example was generated using the command `helm create debian`.

The `templates/` directory contains a very simple pod resource with a
couple of parameters.

The `values.yaml` file contains the default values for the
`debian-pod.yaml` template.

You can install this example using `helm install ./debian`.
